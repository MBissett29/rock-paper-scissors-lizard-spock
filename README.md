This is a javascript mini game. The main purpose for this game is to be fun and interactive. Its aimed to be played when the user has a spare few minutes in their day, whether on a study break or just looking for something to do. This game allows the user to play against the computer, with a risk and reward outcome. The risk being that the user choses an option that they think might beat their opponent, in this case versing the computer. The reward is that their score increases when they beat the computer, until they reset the game.
